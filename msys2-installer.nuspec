This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements

<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>A Cygwin-derived software distro for Windows using Arch Linux's Pacman</summary>
    <description>This lightweight package performs an unattended installation of MSYS2 using official installer. 
    It is intended as an alternative to [msys2](https://chocolatey.org/packages/msys2) and [msys2.install](https://chocolatey.org/packages/msys2.install) packages 
    which might be a better choice for some users.
    
    Major differences when compared to [MSYS2](https://chocolatey.org/packages/msys2) package:
     - Installation is performed from official `.exe` binaries instead of `.tar.xz` archives
     - Unattended installation only without any additional customization or configuration (not even `pacman --noconfirm -Syuu`)
    
    Major differences when compared to [msys2.install](https://chocolatey.org/packages/msys2.install) package:
     - `msys2.install` package is currently broken and not yet approved
     - Support for unattended uninstall
     - QtInstaller window is visible so that user can track progress and optionally answer MessageBox that is hard to automate (e.g. Corrupt_Installation_Error)
